# cii_read_your_sm
Read your own smart meter and vizualize your electricity consumption. Create dashboards with valuable information and share it!

Goal:

Read your Smart Meter through the local Customer Information Interface (CII) and visualize your consumption. Design a dashboard with the most useful information.

Idea:

Two Smart Meters will be installed on-site and will be measuring the consumption of different devices. The live consumption is to be displayed on a web-based dashboard. Live measurements are to be combined with historical data. At the end, the dashboard will be able to display the most important information to an individual about their electricity consumption.

Why:

In Switzerland, it is prescribed by law that all electricity Smart Meters installed by utilities must have a local interface (CII), so that customers can have access to their own data. Transparency is increased as individuals can manage their own data. Innovation is promoted, as precise data is available for free in real time.

Data:

Live measurements from Smart Meters Historical data of an EKZ test site
